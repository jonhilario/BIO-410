## Introduction
This project aims to investigate the evolutionary relationships between different parasites through the analysis of the cytochrome C gene that is present within each one. The organisms studied were Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Toxoplasma gondii, Babesia bovis, and Cyclospora cayetanensis. After obtaining the gene sequences, a multiple sequence alignment was performed in order to compare and contrast the sequences. This was followed by the construction of a phylogenetic tree, which was used to further interpret the present evolutionary relationships and divergence between the parasites. 

Plasmodium falciparum:

This is also a single celled parasite that causes malaria in humans, but is the most frequent cause and is the most widely spread. In order for this parasite to invade red blood cells, the Duffy antigen is required on the surface of cells for infection. This species can also survive in colder climates than other malaria species which leads to wider range of infection.

Toxoplasma gondii:

A parasitic protozoan (single-celled eukaryote) that leads to the infection of toxoplasmosis, which causes muscle aches and flu-like symptoms. Once organisms enter the intestinal epithelium of the hosts, it can spread to other host tissues. As T. gondii cells continue to be replicated, host cells are destroyed. It’s definitive host are cats, which usually spread the organism to other organisms.

Babesia bovis:

Leads to the infection of babesiosis in cattle, which originates from the Rhipicephalus microplus tick species. The virus reproduces sexually when within ticks, but inside the host it reproduces asexually within the red blood cells. The virus infects the tick’s salivary glands and develops into invasive sporozoites, infecting the tick’s next meal and creating a new host.

Cyclospora cayetanensis:

This parasite leads to the disease called Cyclosporiasis, and starts as a waterborne parasite. Oocytes initiate the infection process once ingested. The oocytes then invade the small intestinal lining and sporozoites infect the epithelial cells of the duodenum and jejunum. Within the host the parasite’s meront cells reproduce asexually and then moves to sexual reproduction.

This figure shown depicts our sequence alignemnts in R. We decided to split the alignments up into 5 separate pairs in order to make it easier to decipher. These were supposed to become a full alignment model, but due to multiple errors and package problems in R, we were unable to perform this. From these alignments, we can see that some of them exhibit extremely high scores, while others are very far on the opposite side of the spectrum. This shows that all of the sequences are not highly aligned.
